text_cleaner.py

AI-powered text restoration for PDF-extracted / OCR text.

Fixes issues that regex cannot handle:
  - Same-case merged words:  "cannotdevote" → "cannot devote"
  - OCR character errors:    "Catho Hc" → "Catholic"
  - Garbled characters:      "lihrorum" → "librorum"
  - Contextual spacing:      "isnot" → "is not"

Uses the same DeepSeek API already configured for the pipeline.
Text is processed in paragraph-boundary chunks so arbitrarily long
documents work within the model's context window.

_CLEANUP_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a text restoration specialist. You receive raw text that was \
extracted from a PDF or produced by OCR. Your ONLY job is to fix \
extraction artifacts so the text reads as the original author intended.

WHAT TO FIX:
1. Merged words (missing spaces): "theChurch" → "the Church", \
"cannotdevote" → "cannot devote", "Thisshort" → "This short", \
"isnot" → "is not"
2. OCR character errors: "Catho Hc" → "Catholic", "lihrorum" → \
"librorum", "Biicher" → "Bücher", "verhotenen" → "verbotenen"
3. Punctuation jammed to the next word: ",Books" → ", Books", \
".The" → ". The"
4. Garbled / corrupted characters that are obvious from context
5. Words broken across lines: "m-\\nisit" → "misit"

STRICT RULES:
- Return ONLY the cleaned text — no commentary, no explanations, \
no wrapping.
- DO NOT add, remove, or rearrange any content.
- DO NOT rewrite, paraphrase, or "improve" the writing style.
- DO NOT change the meaning or tone of any passage.
- DO NOT add section headings, bullet points, or formatting that \
was not in the original.
- Preserve all paragraph breaks (blank lines) exactly as they appear.
- Preserve all numbers, dates, prices, and references exactly.
- Preserve foreign-language words and titles unless they are clearly \
garbled OCR output.
- When uncertain whether something is an error or intentional, \
LEAVE IT AS-IS.\

    Send extracted text through DeepSeek to fix OCR / extraction artifacts.

    Processes text in chunks (split at paragraph boundaries) so the model
    never receives more than *chunk_size* characters in a single request.

    Parameters
    ----------
    text : str
        The raw extracted text.
    client : Any
        An OpenAI-compatible client (``openai.OpenAI`` instance).
    chunk_size : int
        Maximum characters per cleanup chunk.  Larger values give the LLM
        more context but use more tokens.

    Returns

    str
        The cleaned text, or the original text if every chunk fails.
